The experimental data contains 3 parts. The instructions are as follows:

Pretreated data.csv -- The data after data preprocessing (total dataset for deep learning methods research).
Train dataset.csv -- Data for deep learning model training. 
Test dataset.csv -- Test data used to test the performance of a trained model.
